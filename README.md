**React Concurrent / Suspense**
A small talk I've made introducing React Suspense / Concurrent mode  
https://slides.com/linking/react-concurrent-and-suspense/fullscreen ([exemple repo here](https://github.com/Liinkiing/react-concurrent-suspense/))

**Klee**
https://github.com/Liinkiing/klee. A WIP, open source, published standalone npm package for a UI kit. Made as an excuse to try **Storybook Chromatic** and usage of some headless lib to handle a11y like **reakit** or **headlessui**. Not made to be as big as some great UI libs like Chakra UI, but mostly for learning purposes.

**Haya UI**
A WIP UI library I'm working on. Made as an excuse to learn **Storybook** and **styled-system** and create truly reusable UI React components. Like above, not made to be as big as some great UI libs like Chakra UI, but mostly for learning purposes
